But for those who reject him, “The stone that the builders rejected has now become the cornerstone.”"},{"VERSE":"8","WORD":"And, “He is the stone that makes people stumble, the rock that makes them fall.” They stumble because they do not obey God’s word, and so they meet the fate that was planned for them."},{"VERSE":"9","WORD":"But you are not like that, for you are a chosen people.
