May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace."},{"VERSE":"8","WORD":"Let me say first that I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith in him is being talked about all over the world."},{"VERSE":"9","WORD":"God knows how often I pray for you. Day and night I bring you and your needs in prayer to God, whom I serve with all my heart by spreading the Good News about his Son."},{"VERSE":"10","WORD":"One of the things I always pray for is the opportunity, God willing, to come at last to see you."},{"VERSE":"11","WORD":"For I long to visit you so I can bring you some spiritual gift that will help you grow strong in the Lord."},{"VERSE":"12","WORD":"When we get together, I want to encourage you in your faith, but I also want to be encouraged by yours."},{"VERSE":"13","WORD":"I want you to know, dear brothers and sisters, that I planned many times to visit you, but I was prevented until now. I want to work among you and see spiritual fruit, just as I have seen among other Gentiles."},{"VERSE":"14","WORD":"For I have a great sense of obligation to people in both the civilized world and the rest of the world, to the educated and uneducated alike."},{"VERSE":"15","WORD":"So I am eager to come to you in Rome, too, to preach the Good News."},{"VERSE":"16","WORD":"For I am not ashamed of this Good News about Christ. It is the power of God at work, saving everyone who believes—the Jew first and also the Gentile."},{"VERSE":"17","WORD":"This Good News tells us how God makes us right in his sight. This is accomplished from start to finish by faith.

Through everything God made, they can clearly see his invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature. So they have no excuse for not knowing God."},{"VERSE":"21","WORD":"Yes, they knew God, but they wouldn’t worship him as God or even give him thanks. And they began to think up foolish ideas of what God was like. As a result, their minds became dark and confused."},{"VERSE":"22","WORD":"Claiming to be wise, they instead became utter fools."},{"VERSE":"23","WORD":"And instead of worshiping the glorious, ever-living God, they worshiped idols made to look like mere people and birds and animals and reptiles."},{"VERSE":"24","WORD":"So God abandoned them to do whatever shameful things their hearts desired. As a result, they did vile and degrading things with each other’s bodies."},{"VERSE":"25","WORD":"They traded the truth about God for a lie. So they worshiped and served the things God created instead of the Creator himself, who is worthy of eternal praise! Amen."},{"VERSE":"26","WORD":"That is why God abandoned them to their shameful desires. Even the women turned against the natural way to have sex and instead indulged in sex with each other."},{"VERSE":"27","WORD":"And the men, instead of having normal sexual relations with women, burned with lust for each other. Men did shameful things with other men, and as a result of this sin, they suffered within themselves the penalty they deserved."},{"VERSE":"28","WORD":"Since they thought it foolish to acknowledge God, he abandoned them to their foolish thinking and let them do things that should never be done."},{"VERSE":"29","WORD":"Their lives became full of every kind of wickedness, sin, greed, hate, envy, murder, quarreling, deception, malicious behavior, and gossip."},{"VERSE":"30","WORD":"They are backstabbers, haters of God, insolent, proud, and boastful. They invent new ways of sinning, and they disobey their parents."},{"VERSE":"31","WORD":"They refuse to understand, break their promises, are heartless, and have no mercy."},{"VERSE":"32","WORD":"They know God’s justice requires that those who do these things deserve to die, yet they do them anyway. Worse yet, they encourage others to do them, too."}]},{"CHAPTER":"2","VERSES":[{"VERSE":"1","WORD":"You may think you can condemn such people, but you are just as bad, and you have no excuse!

Can’t you see that his kindness is intended to turn you from your sin?"},{"VERSE":"5","WORD":"But because you are stubborn and refuse to turn from your sin, you are storing up terrible punishment for yourself.

And the Jews, who do have God’s law, will be judged by that law when they fail to obey it."},{"VERSE":"13","WORD":"For merely listening to the law doesn’t make us right with God. It is obeying the law that makes us right in his sight."},{"VERSE":"14","WORD":"Even Gentiles, who do not have God’s written law, show that they know his law when they instinctively obey it, even without having heard it."},{"VERSE":"15","WORD":"They demonstrate that God’s law is written in their hearts, for their own conscience and thoughts either accuse them or tell them they are doing right."},{"VERSE":"16","WORD":"And this is the message I proclaim—that the day is coming when God, through Christ Jesus, will judge everyone’s secret life."},{"VERSE":"17","WORD":"You who call yourselves Jews are relying on God’s law, and you boast about your special relationship with him."},{"VERSE":"18","WORD":"You know what he wants; you know what is right because you have been taught his law."},{"VERSE":"19","WORD":"You are convinced that you are a guide for the blind and a light for people who are lost in darkness."},{"VERSE":"20","WORD":"You think you can instruct the ignorant and teach children the ways of God. For you are certain that God’s law gives you complete knowledge and truth."},{"VERSE":"21","WORD":"Well then, if you teach others, why don’t you teach yourself? You tell others not to steal, but do you steal?"},{"VERSE":"22","WORD":"You say it is wrong to commit adultery, but do you commit adultery?

And true circumcision is not merely obeying the letter of the law; rather, it is a change of heart produced by the Spirit.

Even if everyone else is a liar, God is true. As the Scriptures say about him,  “You will be proved right in what you say, and you will win your case in court.”"},{"VERSE":"5","WORD":"“But,” some might say, “our sinfulness serves a good purpose, for it helps people see how righteous God is. Isn’t it unfair, then, for him to punish us?” (This is merely a human point of view.)"},{"VERSE":"6","WORD":"Of course not! If God were not entirely fair, how would he be qualified to judge the world?"},{"VERSE":"7","WORD":"“But,” someone might still argue, “how can God condemn me as a sinner if my dishonesty highlights his truthfulness and brings him more glory?”"},{"VERSE":"8","WORD":"And some people even slander us by claiming that we say, “The more we sin, the better it is!” Those who say such things deserve to be condemned."},{"VERSE":"9","WORD":"Well then, should we conclude that we Jews are better than others? No, not at all, for we have already shown that all people, whether Jews or Gentiles, are under the power of sin."},{"VERSE":"10","WORD":"As the Scriptures say, “No one is righteous— not even one."},{"VERSE":"11","WORD":"No one is truly wise; no one is seeking God."},{"VERSE":"12","WORD":"All have turned away; all have become useless.

The law simply shows us how sinful we are."},{"VERSE":"21","WORD":"But now God has shown us a way to be made right with him without keeping the requirements of the law, as was promised in the writings of Moses and the prophets long ago."},{"VERSE":"22","WORD":"We are made right with God by placing our faith in Jesus Christ. And this is true for everyone who believes, no matter who we are."},{"VERSE":"23","WORD":"For everyone has sinned; we all fall short of God’s glorious standard."},{"VERSE":"24","WORD":"Yet God, in his grace, freely makes us right in his sight. He did this through Christ Jesus when he freed us from the penalty for our sins."},{"VERSE":"25","WORD":"For God presented Jesus as the sacrifice for sin. People are made right with God when they believe that Jesus sacrificed his life, shedding his blood. This sacrifice shows that God was being fair when he held back and did not punish those who sinned in times past,"},{"VERSE":"26","WORD":"for he was looking ahead and including them in what he would do in this present time. God did this to demonstrate his righteousness, for he himself is fair and just, and he makes sinners right in his sight when they believe in Jesus."},{"VERSE":"27","WORD":"Can we boast, then, that we have done anything to be accepted by God? No, because our acquittal is not based on obeying the law. It is based on faith."},{"VERSE":"28","WORD":"So we are made right with God through faith and not by obeying the law."},{"VERSE":"29","WORD":"After all, is God the God of the Jews only? Isn’t he also the God of the Gentiles? Of course he is."},{"VERSE":"30","WORD":"There is only one God, and he makes people right with himself only by faith, whether they are Jews or Gentiles."},{"VERSE":"31","WORD":"Well then, if we emphasize faith, does this mean that we can forget about the law?

Well, we have been saying that Abraham was counted as righteous by God because of his faith."},{"VERSE":"10","WORD":"But how did this happen? Was he counted as righteous only after he was circumcised, or was it before he was circumcised? Clearly, God accepted Abraham before he was circumcised!"},{"VERSE":"11","WORD":"Circumcision was a sign that Abraham already had faith and that God had already accepted him and declared him to be righteous—even before he was circumcised. So Abraham is the spiritual father of those who have faith but have not been circumcised. They are counted as righteous because of their faith."},{"VERSE":"12","WORD":"And Abraham is also the spiritual father of those who have been circumcised, but only if they have the same kind of faith Abraham had before he was circumcised."},{"VERSE":"13","WORD":"Clearly, God’s promise to give the whole earth to Abraham and his descendants was based not on his obedience to God’s law, but on a right relationship with God that comes by faith."},{"VERSE":"14","WORD":"If God’s promise is only for those who obey the law, then faith is not necessary and the promise is pointless."},{"VERSE":"15","WORD":"For the law always brings punishment on those who try to obey it. (The only way to avoid breaking the law is to have no law to break!)"},{"VERSE":"16","WORD":"So the promise is received by faith. It is given as a free gift. And we are all certain to receive it, whether or not we live according to the law of Moses, if we have faith like Abraham’s. For Abraham is the father of all who believe."},{"VERSE":"17","WORD":"That is what the Scriptures mean when God told him, “I have made you the father of many nations.” This happened because Abraham believed in the God who brings the dead back to life and who creates new things out of nothing."},{"VERSE":"18","WORD":"Even when there was no reason for hope, Abraham kept hoping—believing that he would become the father of many nations. For God had said to him, “That’s how many descendants you will have!”"},{"VERSE":"19","WORD":"And Abraham’s faith did not weaken, even though, at about 100 years of age, he figured his body was as good as dead—and so was Sarah’s womb."},{"VERSE":"20","WORD":"Abraham never wavered in believing God’s promise. In fact, his faith grew stronger, and in this he brought glory to God."},{"VERSE":"21","WORD":"He was fully convinced that God is able to do whatever he promises."},{"VERSE":"22","WORD":"And because of Abraham’s faith, God counted him as righteous."},{"VERSE":"23","WORD":"And when God counted him as righteous, it wasn’t just for Abraham’s benefit.

For we know how dearly God loves us, because he has given us the Holy Spirit to fill our hearts with his love."},{"VERSE":"6","WORD":"When we were utterly helpless, Christ came at just the right time and died for us sinners."},{"VERSE":"7","WORD":"Now, most people would not be willing to die for an upright person, though someone might perhaps be willing to die for a person who is especially good."},{"VERSE":"8","WORD":"But God showed his great love for us by sending Christ to die for us while we were still sinners."},{"VERSE":"9","WORD":"And since we have been made right in God’s sight by the blood of Christ, he will certainly save us from God’s condemnation."},{"VERSE":"10","WORD":"For since our friendship with God was restored by the death of his Son while we were still his enemies, we will certainly be saved through the life of his Son."},{"VERSE":"11","WORD":"So now we can rejoice in our wonderful new relationship with God because our Lord Jesus Christ has made us friends of God."},{"VERSE":"12","WORD":"When Adam sinned, sin entered the world. Adam’s sin brought death, so death spread to everyone, for everyone sinned."},{"VERSE":"13","WORD":"Yes, people sinned even before the law was given. But it was not counted as sin because there was not yet any law to break."},{"VERSE":"14","WORD":"Still, everyone died—from the time of Adam to the time of Moses—even those who did not disobey an explicit commandment of God, as Adam did. Now Adam is a symbol, a representation of Christ, who was yet to come."},{"VERSE":"15","WORD":"But there is a great difference between Adam’s sin and God’s gracious gift. For the sin of this one man, Adam, brought death to many. But even greater is God’s wonderful grace and his gift of forgiveness to many through this other man, Jesus Christ."},{"VERSE":"16","WORD":"And the result of God’s gracious gift is very different from the result of that one man’s sin. For Adam’s sin led to condemnation, but God’s free gift leads to our being made right with God, even though we are guilty of many sins."},{"VERSE":"17","WORD":"For the sin of this one man, Adam, caused death to rule over many. But even greater is God’s wonderful grace and his gift of righteousness, for all who receive it will live in triumph over sin and death through this one man, Jesus Christ."},{"VERSE":"18","WORD":"Yes, Adam’s one sin brings condemnation for everyone, but Christ’s one act of righteousness brings a right relationship with God and new life for everyone."},{"VERSE":"19","WORD":"Because one person disobeyed God, many became sinners. But because one other person obeyed God, many will be made righteous."},{"VERSE":"20","WORD":"God’s law was given so that all people could see how sinful they were. But as people sinned more and more, God’s wonderful grace became more abundant."},{"VERSE":"21","WORD":"So just as sin ruled over all people and brought them to death, now God’s wonderful grace rules instead, giving us right standing with God and resulting in eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."}]},{"CHAPTER":"6","VERSES":[{"VERSE":"1","WORD":"Well then, should we keep on sinning so that God can show us more and more of his wonderful grace?"},{"VERSE":"2","WORD":"Of course not! Since we have died to sin, how can we continue to live in it?"},{"VERSE":"3","WORD":"Or have you forgotten that when we were joined with Christ Jesus in baptism, we joined him in his death?"},{"VERSE":"4","WORD":"For we died and were buried with Christ by baptism.

Of course not!"},{"VERSE":"16","WORD":"Don’t you realize that you become the slave of whatever you choose to obey? You can be a slave to sin, which leads to death, or you can choose to obey God, which leads to righteous living."},{"VERSE":"17","WORD":"Thank God! Once you were slaves of sin, but now you wholeheartedly obey this teaching we have given you."},{"VERSE":"18","WORD":"Now you are free from your slavery to sin, and you have become slaves to righteous living."},{"VERSE":"19","WORD":"Because of the weakness of your human nature, I am using the illustration of slavery to help you understand all this.

Of course not! In fact, it was the law that showed me my sin.

So I discovered that the law’s commands, which were supposed to bring life, brought spiritual death instead."},{"VERSE":"11","WORD":"Sin took advantage of those commands and deceived me; it used the commands to kill me."},{"VERSE":"12","WORD":"But still, the law itself is holy, and its commands are holy and right and good."},{"VERSE":"13","WORD":"But how can that be? Did the law, which is good, cause my death? Of course not! Sin used what was good to bring about my condemnation to death. So we can see how terrible sin really is. It uses God’s good commands for its own evil purposes."},{"VERSE":"14","WORD":"So the trouble is not with the law, for it is spiritual and good. The trouble is with me, for I am all too human, a slave to sin."},{"VERSE":"15","WORD":"I don’t really understand myself, for I want to do what is right, but I don’t do it. Instead, I do what I hate."},{"VERSE":"16","WORD":"But if I know that what I am doing is wrong, this shows that I agree that the law is good."},{"VERSE":"17","WORD":"So I am not the one doing wrong; it is sin living in me that does it."},{"VERSE":"18","WORD":"And I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my sinful nature.
