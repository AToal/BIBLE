Peace in heaven, and glory in highest heaven!”"},{"VERSE":"39","WORD":"But some of the Pharisees among the crowd said, “Teacher, rebuke your followers for saying things like that!”"},{"VERSE":"40","WORD":"He replied, “If they kept quiet, the stones along the road would burst into cheers!”"},{"VERSE":"41","WORD":"But as he came closer to Jerusalem and saw the city ahead, he began to weep."},{"VERSE":"42","WORD":"“How I wish today that you of all people would understand the way to peace.

Who gave you the right?”"},{"VERSE":"3","WORD":"“Let me ask you a question first,” he replied."},{"VERSE":"4","WORD":"“Did John’s authority to baptize come from heaven, or was it merely human?”"},{"VERSE":"5","WORD":"They talked it over among themselves. “If we say it was from heaven, he will ask why we didn’t believe John."},{"VERSE":"6","WORD":"But if we say it was merely human, the people will stone us because they are convinced John was a prophet.”"},{"VERSE":"7","WORD":"So they finally replied that they didn’t know."},{"VERSE":"8","WORD":"And Jesus responded, “Then I won’t tell you by what authority I do these things.”"},{"VERSE":"9","WORD":"Now Jesus turned to the people again and told them this story: “A man planted a vineyard, leased it to tenant farmers, and moved to another country to live for several years."},{"VERSE":"10","WORD":"At the time of the grape harvest, he sent one of his servants to collect his share of the crop. But the farmers attacked the servant, beat him up, and sent him back empty-handed."},{"VERSE":"11","WORD":"So the owner sent another servant, but they also insulted him, beat him up, and sent him away empty-handed."},{"VERSE":"12","WORD":"A third man was sent, and they wounded him and chased him away."},{"VERSE":"13","WORD":"“‘What will I do?’ the owner asked himself. ‘I know! I’ll send my cherished son. Surely they will respect him.’"},{"VERSE":"14","WORD":"“But when the tenant farmers saw his son, they said to each other, ‘Here comes the heir to this estate. Let’s kill him and get the estate for ourselves!’"},{"VERSE":"15","WORD":"So they dragged him out of the vineyard and murdered him. “What do you suppose the owner of the vineyard will do to them?” Jesus asked."},{"VERSE":"16","WORD":"“I’ll tell you—he will come and kill those farmers and lease the vineyard to others.” “How terrible that such a thing should ever happen,” his listeners protested."},{"VERSE":"17","WORD":"Jesus looked at them and said, “Then what does this Scripture mean? ‘The stone that the builders rejected has now become the cornerstone.’"},{"VERSE":"18","WORD":"Everyone who stumbles over that stone will be broken to pieces, and it will crush anyone it falls on.”"},{"VERSE":"19","WORD":"The teachers of religious law and the leading priests wanted to arrest Jesus immediately because they realized he was telling the story against them—they were the wicked farmers.

You teach the way of God truthfully."},{"VERSE":"22","WORD":"Now tell us—is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?”"},{"VERSE":"23","WORD":"He saw through their trickery and said,"},{"VERSE":"24","WORD":"“Show me a Roman coin.

Instead, they were amazed by his answer, and they became silent."},{"VERSE":"27","WORD":"Then Jesus was approached by some Sadducees—religious leaders who say there is no resurrection from the dead."},{"VERSE":"28","WORD":"They posed this question: “Teacher, Moses gave us a law that if a man dies, leaving a wife but no children, his brother should marry the widow and have a child who will carry on the brother’s name."},{"VERSE":"29","WORD":"Well, suppose there were seven brothers. The oldest one married and then died without children."},{"VERSE":"30","WORD":"So the second brother married the widow, but he also died."},{"VERSE":"31","WORD":"Then the third brother married her. This continued with all seven of them, who died without children."},{"VERSE":"32","WORD":"Finally, the woman also died."},{"VERSE":"33","WORD":"So tell us, whose wife will she be in the resurrection?

In this respect they will be like angels.
