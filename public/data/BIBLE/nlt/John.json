How can he say, ‘I came down from heaven’?”"},{"VERSE":"43","WORD":"But Jesus replied, “Stop complaining about what I said."},{"VERSE":"44","WORD":"For no one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws them to me, and at the last day I will raise them up."},{"VERSE":"45","WORD":"As it is written in the Scriptures, ‘They will all be taught by God.’ Everyone who listens to the Father and learns from him comes to me."},{"VERSE":"46","WORD":"(Not that anyone has ever seen the Father; only I, who was sent from God, have seen him.)"},{"VERSE":"47","WORD":"“I tell you the truth, anyone who believes has eternal life."},{"VERSE":"48","WORD":"Yes, I am the bread of life!"},{"VERSE":"49","WORD":"Your ancestors ate manna in the wilderness, but they all died."},{"VERSE":"50","WORD":"Anyone who eats the bread from heaven, however, will never die."},{"VERSE":"51","WORD":"I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Anyone who eats this bread will live forever; and this bread, which I will offer so the world may live, is my flesh.”"},{"VERSE":"52","WORD":"Then the people began arguing with each other about what he meant. “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?” they asked."},{"VERSE":"53","WORD":"So Jesus said again, “I tell you the truth, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you cannot have eternal life within you."},{"VERSE":"54","WORD":"But anyone who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise that person at the last day."},{"VERSE":"55","WORD":"For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink."},{"VERSE":"56","WORD":"Anyone who eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in him."},{"VERSE":"57","WORD":"I live because of the living Father who sent me; in the same way, anyone who feeds on me will live because of me."},{"VERSE":"58","WORD":"I am the true bread that came down from heaven.

You have the words that give eternal life."},{"VERSE":"69","WORD":"We believe, and we know you are the Holy One of God.”"},{"VERSE":"70","WORD":"Then Jesus said, “I chose the twelve of you, but one is a devil.”"},{"VERSE":"71","WORD":"He was speaking of Judas, son of Simon Iscariot, one of the Twelve, who would later betray him."}]},{"CHAPTER":"7","VERSES":[{"VERSE":"1","WORD":"After this, Jesus traveled around Galilee.

I’m not going to this festival, because my time has not yet come.”"},{"VERSE":"9","WORD":"After saying these things, Jesus remained in Galilee."},{"VERSE":"10","WORD":"But after his brothers left for the festival, Jesus also went, though secretly, staying out of public view."},{"VERSE":"11","WORD":"The Jewish leaders tried to find him at the festival and kept asking if anyone had seen him."},{"VERSE":"12","WORD":"There was a lot of grumbling about him among the crowds. Some argued, “He’s a good man,” but others said, “He’s nothing but a fraud who deceives the people.”"},{"VERSE":"13","WORD":"But no one had the courage to speak favorably about him in public, for they were afraid of getting in trouble with the Jewish leaders."},{"VERSE":"14","WORD":"Then, midway through the festival, Jesus went up to the Temple and began to teach."},{"VERSE":"15","WORD":"The people were surprised when they heard him. “How does he know so much when he hasn’t been trained?” they asked."},{"VERSE":"16","WORD":"So Jesus told them, “My message is not my own; it comes from God who sent me."},{"VERSE":"17","WORD":"Anyone who wants to do the will of God will know whether my teaching is from God or is merely my own."},{"VERSE":"18","WORD":"Those who speak for themselves want glory only for themselves, but a person who seeks to honor the one who sent him speaks truth, not lies."},{"VERSE":"19","WORD":"Moses gave you the law, but none of you obeys it!

Who’s trying to kill you?”"},{"VERSE":"21","WORD":"Jesus replied, “I did one miracle on the Sabbath, and you were amazed."},{"VERSE":"22","WORD":"But you work on the Sabbath, too, when you obey Moses’ law of circumcision. (Actually, this tradition of circumcision began with the patriarchs, long before the law of Moses.)"},{"VERSE":"23","WORD":"For if the correct time for circumcising your son falls on the Sabbath, you go ahead and do it so as not to break the law of Moses. So why should you be angry with me for healing a man on the Sabbath?"},{"VERSE":"24","WORD":"Look beneath the surface so you can judge correctly.”"},{"VERSE":"25","WORD":"Some of the people who lived in Jerusalem started to ask each other, “Isn’t this the man they are trying to kill?"},{"VERSE":"26","WORD":"But here he is, speaking in public, and they say nothing to him.

And you cannot go where I am going.”"},{"VERSE":"35","WORD":"The Jewish leaders were puzzled by this statement. “Where is he planning to go?” they asked. “Is he thinking of leaving the country and going to the Jews in other lands? Maybe he will even teach the Greeks!"},{"VERSE":"36","WORD":"What does he mean when he says, ‘You will search for me but not find me,’ and ‘You cannot go where I am going’?”"},{"VERSE":"37","WORD":"On the last day, the climax of the festival, Jesus stood and shouted to the crowds, “Anyone who is thirsty may come to me!"},{"VERSE":"38","WORD":"Anyone who believes in me may come and drink! For the Scriptures declare, ‘Rivers of living water will flow from his heart.’”"},{"VERSE":"39","WORD":"(When he said “living water,” he was speaking of the Spirit, who would be given to everyone believing in him.

Didn’t even one of them condemn you?”"},{"VERSE":"11","WORD":"“No, Lord,” she said. And Jesus said, “Neither do I. Go and sin no more.”"},{"VERSE":"12","WORD":"Jesus spoke to the people once more and said, “I am the light of the world.

Jesus answered, “Since you don’t know who I am, you don’t know who my Father is.

Abraham never did such a thing."},{"VERSE":"41","WORD":"No, you are imitating your real father.” They replied, “We aren’t illegitimate children! God himself is our true Father.”"},{"VERSE":"42","WORD":"Jesus told them, “If God were your Father, you would love me, because I have come to you from God. I am not here on my own, but he sent me."},{"VERSE":"43","WORD":"Why can’t you understand what I am saying? It’s because you can’t even hear me!"},{"VERSE":"44","WORD":"For you are the children of your father the devil, and you love to do the evil things he does. He was a murderer from the beginning.

He saw it and was glad.”"},{"VERSE":"57","WORD":"The people said, “You aren’t even fifty years old. How can you say you have seen Abraham?”"},{"VERSE":"58","WORD":"Jesus answered, “I tell you the truth, before Abraham was even born, I am!”"},{"VERSE":"59","WORD":"At that point they picked up stones to throw at him.
