# 📖 BIBLE.ngo – The Opensource BIBLE

## 🌍 About BIBLE.ngo

**BIBLE.ngo** is an opensource platform that seeks to **make the BIBLE freely accessible & open to all**. Unlike proprietary BIBLE apps and websites, **BIBLE.ngo is opensource**, allowing people from all around the world to improve, customize, and innovate freely.

🚀 **Our Mission:** Build a BIBLE freely available to everyone, everywhere, with personalized control of the experience.

🌟 **Our Vision:** A collaborative, community-driven initiative to create the most **versatile, customizable, and user-centric BIBLE experience ever built**.

🌐 **Site:** [BIBLE.ngo](https://www.BIBLE.ngo)

## ❓ Why This Project Exists

Despite being the most widely read book in history, the BIBLE has no fully opensource, freely accessible, and widely adopted online platform.
This project exists to:

✅ **Enable True Ownership** – Users should control their BIBLE experience, from fonts & colors to translations & notes.
✅ **Break Free from Proprietary Systems** – Closed-source BIBLE platforms limit access and customization.
✅ **Foster Innovation** – By building a BIBLE that's fully opensource, we can create a next-gen experience.
✅ **Expand Global Access** – Many BIBLE versions are paywalled or geo-restricted.

📢 **We believe the BIBLE should be as free & open as the air we breathe.**
