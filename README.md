## ❓ Why This Project Exists

Despite being the most widely read book in history, the BIBLE has **no fully open-source, freely accessible, and widely adopted platform**.
This project exists to:

✅ **Break Free from Proprietary Systems** – Closed-source BIBLE platforms limit access and customization.
✅ **Enable True Ownership** – Users should control their BIBLE experience, from fonts and colors to translations and notes.
✅ **Expand Global Access** – Many BIBLE versions are paywalled or geo-restricted.
✅ **Foster Innovation** – By making BIBLE data fully open, developers can create next-gen reading experiences.

📢 **We believe the BIBLE should be as free and open as the air we breathe.**
