## 🌍 About BIBLE.ngo

**BIBLE.ngo** is an opensource initiative by **the.ngo** that seeks to **make the BIBLE truly accessible & open to all**. Unlike proprietary BIBLE apps and websites, **BIBLE.ngo is open source**, allowing all people from around the world to improve, customize, and innovate freely.

🚀 **Our Mission:** Build a BIBLE freely available to everyone, everywhere, with personal control of the reading experience.

## ❓ Why This Project Exists

Despite being the most widely read book in history, the BIBLE has **no fully opensource, freely accessible, and widely adopted platform**.
This project exists to:

✅ **Enable True Ownership** – Users should control their BIBLE experience, from fonts & colors to translations & notes.
✅ **Foster Innovation** – By building a BIBLE that's fully opensource, we can create a next-gen experience.
✅ **Break Free from Proprietary Systems** – Closed-source BIBLE platforms limit access and customization.
✅ **Expand Global Access** – Many BIBLE versions are paywalled or geo-restricted.

📢 **We believe the BIBLE should be as free & open as the air we breathe.**
